This is the "In-Water Plastic Bags and Bottles" (WPBB) dataset. 

All shards have 300 samples, hence the total number of samples in this dataset is 900; 500 with plastic bags and
400 with plastic bottles. Annotations are in PASCAL VOC 2012 format.

NOTE: sometimes you may find this dataset referred to as "PBBW" instead of "WPBB" because I changed its name
after a while.
